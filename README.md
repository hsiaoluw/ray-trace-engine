# RayTracingEngine

To run this engine, please open RayTracingEngine.vcxproj on VS2015.

we build a ray trace engine without any external library. Our ray trace engine can show reflection, refraction effect, and shadow. To make the scene more nature, we also do soft-shadow, area light through Monte-Carlo sampling. Normal mapping is also supported in our engine.
The details are in CSCI_580_project.pdf, csci_project_pptversion.pptx
